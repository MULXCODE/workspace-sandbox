  <h1>
    Findex Ferry Terminal!
  </h1>
  <div class="instructions">
    <p>
      Findex has bought a small ferry terminal and two ferries are available at
      any one time.
    </p>

    <p>Ferry Types:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Small Ferry</dt>
      <dd>A Small Ferry can hold 8 small vehicles</dd>
      <dt>Large Ferry</dt>
      <dd>A Large Ferry can hold 6 Large vehicles</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>The Test</h2>
    <p>
      There is an API described by the interface IVehicleProvider which
      currently has one implementation, HardcodedVehicleService, which provides
      a random vehicle at the click of the button. The goal for this test is to
      build out the logic to assign these vehicles to the appropriate ferry and
      to handle when the ferry is full.
    </p>

    <p>
      The requirements are deliberately left vague to give you the opportunity
      to show what you can do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that you are required to submit a solution using
      <strong>angular</strong>, other submissions in e.g. react will not be
      considered. We will take your angular experience (as per your CV/resume)
      into account when assessing your submission.
    </p>

    <h3>Bonus POINTS</h3>
    <p>
      Each car type costs a different amount to board a ferry. The Ferry worker
      earns 10% of the total ticket cost per day.
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Car Type</th>
        <th>Cost</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Car</td>
        <td>$5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Van</td>
        <td>$7.50</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Truck</td>
        <td>$10</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Bus</td>
        <td>$15</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>For each vehicle that boards the ferry calculate how much:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the terminal earns</li>
      <li>the worker earns</li>
    </ul>
